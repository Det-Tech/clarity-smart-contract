Contributions are welcome!

To prepare the project for development, run `npm i` from the root of your local clone/fork.

This project contains a pre-commit script that will generate a new `metadata.json` file and new contents of the `zips` folder based on your changes. This script will run automatically pre-commit, or you can run it manually using the command `npm run build`.
